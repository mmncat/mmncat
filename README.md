- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me on discord (@mnmcat) but i might not be available on discord so if i dont respond email me with FoleyRyanJ@hotmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started getting interested with developing when i was 8 with roblox studio, scratch did NOT help at all and dont think it would help anyone learn real programming fundamentals at all with it only potential problem solving which is important
